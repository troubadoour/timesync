Description: Sdwdate Monitor and User Interface Plugin
 Timesync is a monitor and user interface for sdwdate, bootclockrandomization
 and timesanitycheck. Notifications are dispatched in X and/or tty0 depending
 on availability. Checks bootclockrandomization's status; runs timesanitycheck
 before and after running sdwdate; checks sdwdate's status.
 .
 After boot, sdwdate runs in startup mode. When sdwdate is still in progress
 when X gets available, a progress bar will be shown. Timesync informs with an
 active popup in X if any error has been detected. Otherwise a passive popup in
 X will notify success.
 .
 If sdwdate is still in progress when tty0 gets available, if sdwdate failed or
 succeeded, notifications will be send to tty0.
 .
 These are important information for the user, because a correct clock is
 crucial for security, anonymity and privacy.
 .
 To prevent the user from getting irrelevant information, unless timesync gets
 manually run, later on, when sdwdate runs in daemon mode, no more progress
 bars or success notifications will shown. Only failures will be notified then.
 .
 In other words:
  - sdwdate startup mode: show progress bar if necessary, show failure or
 success messages.
  - sdwdate daemon mode: don't show progress bar or success messages, show
 failure messages
  - sdwdate manual mode: show progress bar, show failure or success messages.
